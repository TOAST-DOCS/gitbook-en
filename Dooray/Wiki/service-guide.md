### Dooray! Getting started with Dooray! Wiki 

Dooray! Wiki allows you to create documents anywhere at any time so you can keep the documents up to date at all times. Personal Wiki as well as Project Wiki is provided for more effective creation and management of documentations with members. Even a member leaves the project, the documentations are still in Wiki, preventing data loss of the organization.

- To use the Wiki, the organization administrator should set 'Drive Service Enabled?' to 'Enabled' in the ‘Manage Organization>Service Settings>Use and Restrictions’.
- After setting to 'Enabled', refresh the screen to see the Wiki menu being exposed on the navigation bar at the top.

### Access to Wiki and Permissions

#### Project Wiki
In Project Wiki, all project members can access Wiki to look up, modify, and write a document. 
It is possible for all members to move the document to other project (with permission) but only its author can delete the document. 

-	Any member can look up, modify, and write documents. Therefore, it is recommended to write documents during project period on Project Wiki rather than PC.
-	Use of Project Wiki allows you to keep the work documents up to date, so you don't need to check the final products during the project period. Even if a member leaves the project, the documents are left in the Wiki, preventing loss of project documents.
-	Only the author can delete the Project Wiki.

#### Public Project Wiki
If all members of the organization must be able to look up and write documents, set the Project Wiki to Public. 
On the Public Project Setting, set Wiki to 'Enable" to expose the Wiki which has been available for the organization members only. 
(For creating a public project, see the Project Help.)

### Compare the Version
When multiple project members are co-writing a document, each updated version is automatically saved and controlled in versions. You can directly compare the documents as to who has added or deleted what. If necessary, you can even restore the document to a previous version.
