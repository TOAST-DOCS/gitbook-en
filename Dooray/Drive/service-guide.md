## Dooray! > Drive > Service Guide

### Dooray! Start Drive 

Dooray! Drive allows you to save files and folders safely and download the latest files anywhere at any time. 
It provides not only My Drive but also Project Drive for members to save and manage files. Therefore, project members can access the latest files. These files are stored in the drive even if members of the project leaves the project, which means data loss is prevented for the organization.

- To use the drive, the organization administrator should set 'Drive Service Enabled?' to 'Enabled' in the ‘Manage Organization&gt;Service Settings&gt;Use and Restrictions’.
- After setting to 'Enabled', refresh the screen to view the Drive menu exposed on the navigation bar at the top.

### My Drive 

#### Upload File and Folder

- Dooray! - When starting the Dooray! Drive service, you can see the ‘+Upload File’ menu at the top left of the page. 
- In Chrome browser, if you click the down arrow key on the right side of the ‘Upload File' menu, the ‘Folder Upload’ menu is separately displayed, allowing a separate action of uploading a folder. However, since Internet Explorer browser does not support the Folder Upload feature, you should upload files after directly performing 'Add Folder' to the Drive.

#### Download File

- Select the files or folders in the Drive and the 'Download' menu will be enabled at the top of the list. Click ‘Download’ to save the files in the default download folder of your PC. 
- When you try to download more than four files, the files are downloaded with the file name ‘1st file name.zip’.

#### Move and Copy File

- Select the files or folders in the Drive and select the 'Move' or 'Copy' menu at the top of the list. 
- Dooray! - In Dooray! Drive, you can move files or folders within the current drive only. Only you can use My Drive now, however Project Drive is used by project members together. Therefore, if the members move any file to another project drive, you cannot track the file. To prevent any problem, 'Move' is available within the current drive only, and 'Copy' is available to another project drive, too.

#### Delete, Permanent Delete, or Restore File

- You can delete files or folders directly from My Drive. 
- When a file is deleted, the file will be moved to Trash Bin. Files moved to Trash Bin can be restored by the person who deleted them. When restored, files are moved to the original file path. 
- Please select and permanently delete unnecessary files in Trash Bin. This can save the drive space.

### Project Drive 

#### Add Project Drive

- Project Drive can be accessed and used by project members together. 
-  Like Dooray! Project Calendar, the project manager should enable the Project Drive to be able to use it.
- Enabling Project Drive can be set in each ‘Project Settings&gt;Project Drive’ area.

> If ‘dooray-SiteRebuilding’ (dooray-웹개편) project is in progress and the drive is set to Enabled in the Project Settings, then as you access the Dooray! Drive Service page,
you will see that the 'dooray-SiteRebuilding’ (dooray-웹개편) drive has been created on the > left menu.

### Access Permissions to Drive and File  

#### Project Drive
Just like Project Calendar, any project members can access their Project Drive to manage their files and folders. You can read and write files as well as deleting, moving, and copying files.

- Since any members can upload and modify files, it is recommended to upload your products created during the project period instead of saving in local PCs. 
- Use of Project Drive allows you to keep the files up-to-date, so you don't need to check the final projects during the project period. Even if a member leaves the project, the files are left in the drive, which means data loss is prevented.
- Any project members can delete files and folders in their Project Drive. Deleted files are moved to Trash Bin of the Project Drive.
- Anyone can restore deleted files from Trash Bin; however, only project manager can perform Permanent Delete.
- The list of files permanently deleted by the project manager will be saved in the Dooray! server and a screen to view the list of permanently deleted files will be provided soon.  

#### Public Project Drive
To allow all members of an organization to access the drive and read/write files, create a Public Project Drive. More information on Public Project will be described in Create Project. After creating a public project, enable the drive in Project Settings to show the accessible drive to members of the organization.  

###   Change History

When project members access and use files and folders together, you don't have to worry about any file loss or changes even if you didn't permanently delete them. The files and folders in your Project Drive cannot be moved into other drives. If a file is moved to other drive, only the members of the corresponding project drive can track the file. 

- Dooray! Project Drive allows movement of files and folders within the drive only, but copying to other drive is available.
- When you select a file or folder from drive file list, the right area shows changed information of the file or folder in the chronological order, such as creation, movement, copy, deletion, and renaming of the folder and adding files to the folder, as well as movement, copy, deletion, and renaming of the selected file. This helps you track file changes easily even when a group of members handle those files together.


### Joint Editing
- Multiple users can co-ed one document in real time and view the changes directly within the editing screen.
- Extensions that support joint editing are 'hwp', 'xxx', 'xxls', 'cell', 'docx', 'doc', 'pptx', 'ppt', and 'show'.
- If you click 'Joint Edit' in the right preview pane after clicking on a file, the co-editing function will be activated.
