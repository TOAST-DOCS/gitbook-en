<center>[Figure 1]Welcome to Project Guide</center>


And then the Editor setup screen will be displayed, which is very important in Dooray!. The set values are used by Register New Task window, Quick Register New Task window, Write a Comment window, and Write a Comment to Stream window. When you want to change the editor settings, click the Setting icon at the right corner of the Editor to change the default editor anytime.

#### WYSIWYG Editor

WYSIWYG Editor provides an environment which is similar to a commonly used word processor. Even if you use WYSIWYG Editor, the actually used format for saving is not HTML but Markdown format, which will be described next.

#### Markdown Editor

Markdown is a document in a text-based format. Different from WYSIWYG, Markdown may be a bit unfamiliar in the beginning; but you can begin to write text much faster after learning a few formats as follows.

Level from - Title1\-6 (Adjusting the font size for title)
    - Depending on the number of ‘\#’, the font size changes. ‘\#’ is for Title1 and ‘\#\#\#\#\#\#’ is for Title6, the smallest font size for title.

- List
    - Enter ‘\*’ followed by a blank and then type text.
    - For indentation, press the \[TAB\] key. For negative indentation, press the \[Shift\]+\[TAB\] keys. It works in the same way as Microsoft Word.

### Create a Project 

Dooray! Project provides various ways to group tasks for easy management. The most common way is to group and manage relevant tasks as a project. At the top right of Dooray!, click the Setting icon and then select 'Add Project' from the project menu.

![Add a Project](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_dooray_project/05_setting_add_project.png)
<center>[Figure 5] Setting&gt; Project &gt;Add Project </center>

If 'My Project' has already been created, click the + icon next to the project and select 'Add Project'. Enter a project name and click 'Add'.

### Invite a member

After creating a project, you can invite members immediately. If you are already a member of a project, you can invite members even if you are not a project manager. 

![Invite](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_dooray_project/07_pjt_invite.png)

### Register a Task

Click the 'New Task' button at the top left. The task registration window is almost the same as the Mail registration window. Just like writing an email, type in the owner, title, and body. Select a project and enter your name in the Owner field. Enter one more person. Enter the title and the body simply and then click the 'Save' button. Although we have entered the owner, title, and body in this exercise, you can also register a new task by typing in the title field only.

### Set the Completion Date

You can set the completion date when registering a new task; however, you can also change or set a completion date after registration. Click Set Completion Date at the top right of the task, and enter the desired date and click Save. The person who has registered the task is not the only one who can modify the completion date. The owner, CC, and any project members can modify the date. If a person requested to complete the task at a certain date, but the deadline cannot be met, the owner can change the completion date. All of these changes are logged as history and can be looked up at any time. 

You can check the history by clicking History between the task body and comment fields.

<center>[Figure 8] Set and Change the Completion Date</center>

### Modify Task

On the previous Read screen, we have changed the completion date only; however, you can modify all things related to the task at once by clicking the 'Edit' button. Change the title, owner, CC, body and attachments and then click 'Save' to see the changes.

### Check My Task List 

Dooray! With Dooray! Project, you can check all the tasks where you are assigned as an owner at a glance. My Task Box shows all tasks in which you are included as an owner. However, My Task Box applies the option to filter and exclude completed tasks by default. To check the completed tasks together, you must turn off the filter option.

![Completion Date](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_dooray_project/09_pjt_filter.png)
<center>[Figure 9] Set the Exclude Completed Tasks Filter</center>

Tasks can be sorted based on the completion (request) date, registration date, and update data. Various filter options including 'Exclude Completed Tasks' can be applied.

### Change My Task Status

When registering a task, the initial status is 'Registered'. Later, you can change the status to 'In Progress' by clicking the 'Progress' button at the top of the task screen. After completing the task, click the 'Complete' button to change the status. Whenever changing the task status, the color of the owner's name will also be changed. When the task statuses are ‘Registered’, 'In Progress', and 'Completed', the name colors are black, blue, and gray, respectively.

### Communication with Replies

Comment is not just a space to write a simple contents. You can write a very long paragraph or insert an image such as a design draft. When compared with email, the comment has a similar role as Reply to All. When a comment is added, a notification is sent to everyone typed in the registrant, owner, and CC. However, notification may not be sent to some people depending on the settings of each registrant, owner, and CC. However, when a mention is made (e.g. ‘@Hong_Gildong’), a notification is sent to the mentioned user regardless of the setting.

### Manage Task Box 

#### Check tasks where I am mentioned: @mentioned task

- If you are doing a task as a project member, you can enhance the task efficiency by communicating with the ‘@name' mention in the body or comment. 
- Without having to check the whole list of tasks, if you just see the tasks that mentioned you, you can easily check all the tasks you should refer to or you are assigned with as an owner. Use the mention feature when you task on a project.

#### Check tasks where I starred: Starred task

- If you have an important task, click the star icon in front of the task title to change the color of the star to yellow. 
- All starred tasks can be viewed in the Starred Task Box at a glance. Star-mark tasks as important.

#### Collective View of My Replies: My Comment Box 

- We discuss with others using so many comments and replies in a task. When this happens, you might want to check what comments you have written and catch up with the conversation after your last comment. You don't have to search and find every project task one by one. Just click ‘My Comment Box' to view all of your comments. This is Dooray!'s unique function which is not provided by any other services, which allows you to manage your comments in a simple way.

### Check My Task Status

#### Check the status of tasks I registered: Sent Task Box 

- If you have registered task to your colleagues, project members or team members, you will wonder how the task is going on. At this time, you can use the 'Sent Task Box'. The ‘My Task Box’ shows the tasks of which owner is you, and the ‘Sent Task Box’ shows the tasks registered by you. 
- From the ‘Sent Task Box’, see the color of the owner name to get the current status of the task. When the task statuses are ‘Registered’, 'In Progress', and 'Completed', the name colors are black, blue, and gray, respectively. From the task list, you can intuitively understand the task progress status and the personal progress of the task by clicking it.

#### Check the task status of a specific project: Dashboard 

- As a PM (Project Manager), you will wonder how the project you have been put in charge is going on. At this time, you can use the link of each project from 'My Project'.

![Dashboard](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_dooray_project/12_pjt_dashboard.png)
<center>[Figure 12] Project Dashboard</center>

- As you see in ‘My Task Box’, you can also filter tasks you want to see.
