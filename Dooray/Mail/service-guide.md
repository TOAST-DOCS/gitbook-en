#### POP3 (Post Office Protocol)/IMAP (Internet Messaging Access Protocol) 
POP3 and IMAP are the protocols for receiving mails. POP3 is a protocol that downloads mails on the mail server to user's computer. It periodically checks the inbox in the server and downloads mails to user's computer. POP3 is designed to delete mail from the server if it is downloaded by the user to his or her computer. Therefore, it is not available for other computers to read the mail in the server once the mail has been downloaded. 

IMAP is a protocol to access the mail server to read mails. You can read mails on various devices including multiple computers, laptops, and smartphones. IMAP synchronizes mails across all devices, providing highly flexible and great performance when compared to POP3.   

#### IMAP/SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Settings
Dooray! Dooray! Mail supports IMAP not POP3 for receiving mails. Dooray! Mail, you should set the IMAP and the SMTP which is a standard protocol used to send mails on Internet. 

To set IMAP and SMTP, go to [Settings > Mail > IMAP] menu and refer to the setting guide. Register the mail program or application to use by referring to settings.
