## Data & Analytics > Log & Crash Search > Console User Guide

Log & Crash Search can be applied in the following order:

- Enable Service
Create a project on the console and enable Log & Crash Search.
- Send Logs  
Start sending logs via Log & Crash Search SDK.
- Check Logs  
Go to **Log Search** or **App Crash Search** to find logs in many ways, like a chart or search function.

## Select a Project

Access console and select an organization and project from menu on the left. When there is no organization or project available, create one.
- Select **ORGANIZATION > PROJECT** from the menu on the left.

See the [NHN Cloud Console Guide](https://docs.toast.com/en/TOAST/en/console-guide/) for how to create an organization and a project.

## Enable the Service

While a project is selected, click **Service** on top of the screen and go to **Log & Crash Search** under **Data & Analytics** and enable it. When a service is enabled, (v) is displayed by the service name.

> [Note]  
> You can send logs in about five minutes after service is enabled.

When Log & Crash Search is enabled, **Data & Analytics > Log & Crash Search** shows on the menu, with the Appkey created.

## Check Appkey

To send logs, it is required to check Appkey.

1. Click **Data & Analytics > Log & Crash Search > Log Search** on the left navigation menu.
2. Click **URL & Appkey** on top of the screen and check Appkey.

## Send Logs

To send a log, Log & Crash Search SDK is required.
You can download an SDK from **Data & Analytics > Log & Crash Search** of [NHN Cloud Downloads](https://docs.toast.com/en/Download/)

> [Note]  
> When using the SDK, session logs sent along with crash logs are not exposed on the search screen.</br>
> When sending session logs, the count is added to and reflected in the number of daily log capacity of [Resource Provision Policy](https://docs.toast.com/en/TOAST/en/resource-policy/#log-crash-search) in the same way as other logs. However, it is not reflected in the API call charges.

## Search Logs

Logs can be searched by using Log Search.

1. Click **Data & Analytics > Log & Crash Search > Log Search**.
2. **Log Search** provides around-the-clock log-volume graphs with details.

Details of the **Log Search** screen are as below.

### Log Alarm Setting

![lcs_13_202108](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_logncrash/lcs_13_202108_en.png)

Provide all log alarm functions:

- Alarms are classified by the number of occurrences and by the rate of increase/decrease.
- Register a log type (Lucene query) to receive alarms and send alarms depending on the conditions when a log occurs.
- Alarms exist in two types: **Number of Occurrences**, and **Rate of Increase/Decrease**.
- Click **Add Alarms** to register an alarm.

![lcs_14_202108](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_logncrash/lcs_14_202108_en.png)

- The following describes how to set an alarm.
    - Alarm Title: Enter name to show on the list of alarm setting.
    - Alarm Query: Enter a log type to receive alarms for in Lucene Query.
    - Description: Enter a description of the alarm.
    - Alarm type: Set the alarm type by the number of occurrence or increase/decrease rate
    - When the alarm type is the number of occurrence
        - Alarm Rule: Select the inequality sign to be applied to the **Threshold**.
        - Threshold: An alarm is sent when the number of generated logs corresponding to 'Search Condition' matches the number of 'Threshold' in relation to the 'Alarm Rule' inequality sign.
        - Occurrence Cycle: Enter the value in minutes. An alarm is sent only when the number of generated logs matches 'Threshold' within the entered time value.
    - When the alarm type is increase/decrease rate
        - Threshold: Increase/decrease rate of the logs corresponding to the 'Search Condition'. A positive number is the increase rate of logs compared to the previous interval, 0 means that the number of logs is equal to the previous interval, and a negative number is the decrease rate of logs compared to the previous interval.
        - Comparison Time: Enter the value in minutes. The number of logs between the entered time interval and the previous interval is compared based on the 'Threshold Value'. An alarm is sent if the increase/decrease rate of the logs generated during the 'Comparison Time' satisfies the 'Threshold'.
    - Snooze: Enter by the minute, between 1 and 1,440 (24 hours); off for 0.
    - Recipient: Enter recipients to send an alarm to; choose email or SMS for each recipient.
